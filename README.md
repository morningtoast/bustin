New York City is being overrun by ghosts! Who you gonna call?

Take control of your favorite Ghostbuster and try to stop the onslaught of Slimers through 5 frantic levels of arcade action. Choose from Abby, Erin, Patty and Holtzmann. And if you're good enough, you might just unlock a few of your old Ghostbuster friends too. Good luck!

Stop the Slimers from reaching the city. Use your proton beam to bust ghosts and destroy the mirror portals. Your slime meter will fill as ghosts get by you. If your slime meter gets full, it's game over. And watch out...you don't want your proton pack to overheat!

You have unlimitd traps but can only throw one trap at a time, so manage your need wisely. And keep an eye out for the Stay Puft marshmallow man...it means the city is almost filled with slime.

## About this game
My 5-year-old daughter loves Ghostbusters and while she's not really into video games just yet, I decided to make her a Ghostbusters game to maybe nudge her along a little bit. She's seen all the movies but likes the new Ghostbusters the most, so this game features the lady Ghostbusters...but don't worry, you can unlock Peter and the gang...just keep bustin'!

All in all, it's a simple game...basically Tapper with Ghostbusters. It's not that difficult but I pretty much made with my kid in mind. It'll be a tough challenge for her but for us "experienced" gamers it'll be a fun but brief playthrough.

Feedback and bug reports are welcome and encouraged. Thanks to everyone that helped in development. Brian Follick for turning the Ghostbusters theme into a Pico-8 track. @BeetleInTheBox for the extra graphics in short notice. And the great Pico-8 community for the support, snippets and encouragement to actually finish a game...thanks!

This is a Pico-8 game made for my daughter featuring the Ghostbusters.
